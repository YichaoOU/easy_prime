### Raw deepPE data

- lib1.csv
- lib2.csv

These two files were downloaded from their supplementary table.


### Raw PrimeDesign data

- primedesign.pegRNA.tsv
- primedesign.eff.tsv

These two files were downloaded from their supplementary table. 
Even though they validated 20 sites, some were actually done with different pegRNA/ngRNA combinations. 
So totally unique edit is 33. 
See `PrimeDesign_sites_featurization-clean.ipynb` for converting the raw file to the pegRNA/ngRNA sequences.
