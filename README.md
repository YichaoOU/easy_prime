# Easy-Prime: An Optimized Prime Editor gRNA Design Tool Based On Ensemble Learning

Most known pathogenic mutations can be corrected by prime editor, a new advanced genome editing technology that consists of a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease, an engineered reverse transcriptase, and a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Although numerous CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA design tools are available, the pegRNA has more unique features that makes it cubersome for even experienced researchers to design, not to mention a large-scale pegRNA design.
